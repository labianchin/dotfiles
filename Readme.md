My Dotfiles
===========

## What?

These are my dotfiles configuration. It is mostly zsh, vim and tmux. But there are also OS specific configuration. In OSX I use slate and iTerm2. In Linux I use gvim, xbindkeysrc, xcape and conky.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/labianchin/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && bash ~/dotfiles/install.sh
```


## TODO

- Put common binaries
- Configure install for common tools (zsh, tmux, vim, ack, ag, ...)
